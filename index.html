          <p class="project-details">
            This C++ project demonstrates the use of linked lists for handling polynomial equations. It features two main classes: Node, representing individual polynomial terms, and LinkedList, managing a collection of these nodes as a complete polynomial. The program reads polynomials from a file, parses them into linked lists, and evaluates them. Key features include dynamic memory management, operator overloading for intuitive operations like adding terms or printing polynomials, and efficient manipulation of linked lists. This implementation highlights practical applications of object-oriented programming and data structures in a mathematical context.

          <p class="project-details">
            This Java project is a comprehensive application designed to efficiently manage and book seats in an auditorium. It consists of several core components, including the Order, Node, Seat, and Auditorium classes, each serving a specific purpose. The Order class handles user orders, capturing user details, seat selections, and ticket types, and supports operations such as adding, deleting, and viewing orders. The Node class represents seats in the auditorium through a two-dimensional linked list, facilitating easy traversal and manipulation of the seating grid. The Seat class encapsulates seat details, including row, position, and ticket type. The Auditorium class manages the seating grid, allowing for the building of the grid from a file, seat availability validation, reservation, and release. It also offers functionality to find the best available seats based on user preferences and generates visual representations of the seating arrangement. The Main class serves as the application's entry point, handling user login, seat reservation, order management, and administrative functions like generating reports. This project demonstrates strong adherence to object-oriented programming principles, effective data structure manipulation, and user interaction in a practical real-world scenario.

          <p class="project-details">
This Sudoku validation application is a powerful tool that checks the integrity of Sudoku puzzles from various input files, verifying if they are solved, valid, or invalid. It analyzes the puzzles, ensuring they adhere to Sudoku rules and reports detailed error information if inconsistencies are found. This tool is essential for Sudoku enthusiasts and developers working with Sudoku puzzles in different formats, providing reliable validation and analysis capabilities.
